Haskell practice problems.


OUTSTANDING CHALLENGES:
7: flatten nested lists
    The data type and function are written, but how to use them is occluded
8: eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements
    e.g. 'aaabbbaaa' -> 'aba'
9: pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists
    e.g. 'aaabbbaaa' -> (('aaa'), ('bbb'), ('aaa'))
10: runlenghts of char in string
    e.g. 'aaabbbaa' -> [('a', 3), ('b', 3), ('a', 2)]
